# WTG
![ashgdyha](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7645e719-da51-4c47-9879-56ca3f4cd1ee)

this project was created using html, tailwind, and react all in ONE file!

this is a submission for 10 days of tarot using cards:
- main functionality is randomness
- using only one file

### What is this?
WTG (where to go) is a random picker for places to hangout with friends if you've got undecisive friends. Basically everyone will put on places they consider going and the wheel will randomly select one (if the group can't).

Additionally, the wheel would not show the place each person added so that no one would be blamed if the place they went to sucked ;D This takes the pressure off suggesting places!

### How it Works?

1. Make everyone put a place (or more) they want to hangout
2. Don't let anyone see what anyone puts in the wheel
4. You can now spin the wheel
5. The wheel will randomly select a place
6.You can respin the wheel if the group doesn't want the place
